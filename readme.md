# Notebooks for Essential Math for Data Science by Thomas Nield

Data science is math heavy and computers are for math and I've been working with computers for a while. Still, it was time to dust off those college math skills (and then some), so I picked up [Essential Math for Data Science](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/essential-math-for/9781098102920/).

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I used as my scratch pad as I worked through the book. The exercises here are my own, not exactly the code samples from the book unless there was no other way to express similar concepts (e.g., the interest rate calculation exercise). I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor. If you are reading this on [https://github.com/jimleonardo/essential_math_for_data_science/blob/main/chapter1.ipynb](my Github repository), you can see the results of executing the notebooks on line, no need to install Jupyter anywhere to see the results!

All code is Python 3.10 with the SymPy package.
